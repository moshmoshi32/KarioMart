Andrew Kart

To run Andrew Kart, you can either extract the zip file that is included with this project and run the executable
or you can add it into your Unity list by clicking on Open and then selecting the folder that you downloaded.

Andrew Kart is a 2 player mario kart esque game where the goal is to reach the finish line as fast as possible.
Each level can be configured with different spawn points, check points and laps. You can edit these in the Level Data Scriptable object

The game also features power ups which the players can pick up and use, each level is seperate from eachother so that you can easily start at any level without needing to start-
from a specific level, so if you wanted to try out X level, you would set it in the initzilation scriptable object that would then setup everything and
send you to the level that you wanted to start from. It also features a leaderboard that tracks the best 5 players for each level.

Some of the difficult parts were how I would setup the UI, the UI could be done MUCH better than what I have made right now, as I had a main menu script take care of-
what happens in one set of menus while I had another UIManager take care of the other set of UI which I thought was horribly made however, it does work
